				<h1>Best Western Hotel Block</h1>

				<div class="body">
					<p>
						 From Michael Tang:
					</p>
					<p>
						I made a room block reservation at the Best Western
						University Inn for the night of 4/24 and 4/25. If you plan on attending
						the concert and plan on getting some sleep one of those nights, you can
						call the hotel directly to pick up one of the rooms from the block. The
						rate is $119 (compared to $169 for that weekend at the Best Western or
						$240 at the Statler) and the rooms are blocked under "Cuttin' Class 25"
						when you call. I only blocked 15 rooms, but if we pick up all of them, I
						can probably get more rooms added. However, these rooms are only
						guaranteed up to one month prior to the concert. After that, it'll depend
						on how the hotel is doing in terms of reservations. It seems to be a busy
						weekend in Ithaca (I think it might be a parent visit weekend for
						Cornell), so it's a good idea to pick up a room early if you'll need one.
