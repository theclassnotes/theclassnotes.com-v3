					Emma's first word was "cookie" and let's just say the word makes many appearances on her 
					scrabble board (although alone its score is only 12 points). Yes, this is Emma Dahlia 
					Thanhauser, a cilantro-hating vegetarian Class Notes Newbie! Besides her distinct passion for 
					take-out and cookies, Emma is a proud New Yorker who never wears flat shoes, even if she 
					has to run across town from Sephora to Central Park. Additionally, her wardrobe is mostly 
					black, not because she detests colors, but because black goes with everything for everything, 
					and Emma is always prepared- despite the fact she was never a Girl Scout. Of course, this 
					is why Emma is such an important member of the Class Notes: she's equipped, well organized 
					and always ready to dance. And boy do the Class Notes love to dance.
