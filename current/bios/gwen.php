					New York City resident and the sassiest girl on the dance floor,
Gwendolyn Eve Waichman does not mess around when it comes to her pizza
bagels. As far as she is concerned, CTB's long Sunday brunch line
can't get between her and her personal prize.  After said bagel, Gwen,
a senior in ILR, does one of the following: 1) Befriends strangers
because they have a cute dog she wants to steal, 2) Shows off her
fencing skills, dueling on the Arts Quad, 3) Eats funfetti cake, which
comes from a BOX, much to the chagrin of her pastry chef mother, or
4) Belts really, REALLY loudly (you can hear it from North Campus to
Collegetown) while singing with her favorite a cappella group, The
Class Notes.
