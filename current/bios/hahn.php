					Alexander J. Hahn is special. It all started in Montessori Kindergarten when Alex 
					picked up useless swimming pool tricks and continues today with Alex’s inability to 
					raise his hand to speak. But really, Alex is quite accomplished. In high school he was the 
					ranked third for tennis in the great state of New Jersey. And considering the lack of 
					athleticism among the Class Notes, he is an incredible asset to the group. Our good friend 
					Alex is also “very concerned about his digestive health.” On a similar note, his favorite 
					yogurt is Activia.
