					Although Lindsay was born in Syracuse and raised in Saratoga, she currently resides 
					in Olin Café. This is convenient considering her caffeine addiction and love of scholarly 
					pursuits (those scholarly pursuits that any hotelie would pursue). She may even pay for your 
					coffee, and she will certainly enjoy it with you! Besides her life in Olin Café, Lindsay 
					enjoys walking barefoot and eating M&Ms in colored pairs. Sometimes she even does these two 
					things simultaneously. And one day, she’ll have a cute small dog in her purse and live 
					happily ever after.
