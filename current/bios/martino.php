					[Martino] Alex’s wisdom teeth are growing in and it hurts. Yet somehow, Alex triumphs 
					every day to give guided tours on campus, spend time being fratty with his bros, go 
					to hours of bioengineering class and be an a cappella heartthrob with the Class Notes. 
					As an Italian food enthusiast, Alex spent some of his years working as a pizza delivery 
					boy. Often, he would snatch a slice for himself, particularly if it was pineapple and ham. 
					He does not enjoy long walks on the beach, because he considers handstand competitions and 
					Ultimate Frisbee to be much better uses of beach time.  Despite Alex's busy schedule, 
					from the pizza eating to learning in the classroom, he still finds time to watch <i>Glee</i>..
