					Grace Epstein is a Psychology Major, which means she can read your mind and predict the future. 
					She also likes to believe that her sweet moves qualify her for a dance minor. In addition to 
					singing at frequencies that crack glass, Grace enjoys sprinting up East Buffalo Street and then 
					eating copious amounts of chocolate as a reward. As musical director, she has finally mastered 
					the art of pitch pipe blowing (TWSS) and conducting while bopping around, smiling, and wearing 
					3-inch heels. It's a milestone.
